About
-----
R - written by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka.
R - a language for statistical computing and graphics.
R - solve statistics, time series, classification and other data science tasks.
R - an open source programming language for statistical computing.
R - inspired by S+, it is similar to the S programming.

Variables in R - case sensitive
--------------
A variable can be a combination of
    letters
    digits
    periods
    underscore

Some of the valid Variables              Invalid Variables
---------------------------              -----------------
total                                    tot@l
sum                                      5um
.count                                   _count
.count.total                             TRUE
Var                                      .0ar
my_string

Built in Functions
------------------
a=10
class() = to find the class of the variable (Ex: 10 - "numeric")
typeof() =  to find the type of the variable (Ex: 10 - "double")
print() = print in the console 
just variable ex:- a = print in the console

Data types in R
---------------

Logical - TRUE, FALSE
numeric - 10.5, 7, 855
Integer - 3L, 40L, 5L
Complex - 3+2i
Character - 'a','hello','hi'
Raw - 'Hello' is stored as 48 65 6c 6c 6f



n <- 10L  - L denotes the number as Integer
typeof(n) - Integer
class(n) -  Integer

n <- 10 - without L it denotes a double or numeric
typeof(n) - double
class(n) - numeric

Arithmetic operators are same as python 

logical operators 

and - &
or - |
not - !
